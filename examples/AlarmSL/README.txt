This is the alarm example from the VDM-SL book, John Fitzgerald and
Peter Gorm Larsen, Modelling Systems -- Practical Tools and Techniques
in Software Development}, Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition
2009. The example is inspired by a subcomponent of a large alarm
system developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of alarms
for an industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify the
rules governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal
with alarms. A comparable model of this example also exists in VDM++.
